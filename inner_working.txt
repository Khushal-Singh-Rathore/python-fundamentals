1. Is python a interpreted language or compiled language?
-> In modern way python is a hybrid, because the source code is compled to byte code and then .pyc [byte code] is intrepreted by python vm.

2. How python works?

-> File Code -> Intrepretor (it convert our written code into byte code) -> Byte Code -> Python Virtual Machine ( this is installed with python)

3. Process of working?

-> Compile written code -> Byte Code [it's low level and platform independent, it means it can run on any python vm]
-> Byte code runs faster
-> .pyc is compiled python 
-> __pycache__ is a folder auto created by Python to store compiled bytecode [.pyc files you can say]
-> .py = source code
-> .pyc = pre-processed, ready-to-run version


* The byte code here is just for python it's not universal machine code. It's only uses by pvm to intrepret the program.
* Python Virtual Machine is the engine of python which runs .pyc [byte code] and direct .py code also. Just like top level files are not converted to .pyc


* Mutable and Immutable in python?
-> In very basic term immuatble means you can't change value at memory addresses, if nothing is pointing to that memrory address then it will get delete by garbage collector. And in mutable means you can change at address.
